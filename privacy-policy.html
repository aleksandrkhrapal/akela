									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>If you do not provide us with the information we request, we may not be able to fulfill the applicable purpose of collection, such as to supply products or services to you or to assess your application for employment.</li>
								<li>Where practicable, we will collect personal information directly from you. We may also collect personal information about you from third parties such as your financial institution with your authorisation. If we receive information about you from someone else, we will take reasonable steps to ensure you are aware that we have collected personal information about you and the circumstances of the collection.</li>

							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							Use and disclosure of personal information
							<ol>
								<li>We will only use and disclose your personal information in accordance with Privacy Laws and this Privacy Policy.</li>
								<li>Our main purposes for collecting, holding, using and disclosing personal information are the following:
									<ol>
										<li><span>a.</span> to supply products or services to our customers;</li>
										<li><span>b.</span> to obtain products and services from our suppliers;</li>
										<li><span>c.</span> to respond to enquiries from existing or prospective customers seeking information about our products or services;</li>
										<li><span>d.</span> to improve the products and services that we supply to you;</li>
										<li><span>e.</span> to carry out processes associated with the services we provide, including fraud screening, identity verification, electronic funds transfers and account monitoring;</li>
										<li><span>f.</span> to process and assess employment applications;</li>
										<li><span>g.</span> to enforce agreements between you and Akela;</li>

										<li><span>k.</span> to provide information to, and respond to queries from, shareholders or suppliers.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>We generally explain at the time we collect personal information how we will use or disclose that information. We will only use or disclose personal information for a purpose other than for which it was collected or a related purpose if you have consented to such different use or disclosure or such use or disclosure is otherwise allowed by the Privacy Laws.</li>
								<li>In carrying out our business, it may be necessary to share information about you with and between our affiliates and organisations that provide services to us.</li>
								<li>We may aggregate information that we collect and use it for purposes outside the scope of this Privacy Policy. Any aggregated data used for those purposes will have all personally identifiable information removed.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Service providers
							<ol>
								<li>We use service providers to help us provide our products and services, and to carry out our business operations. This includes independent contractors and consultants, off-site security storage providers, and providers of electronic fund transfer services, account monitoring, account aggregation and identity verification services, including Dun &amp; Bradstreet. You agree that we may provide your personal information to these service providers to use in connection with the supply of services to you and that they may provide us with your personal information to enable us to provide services to you.</li>
								<li>We may also provide your personal information to third parties who offer goods or services that you may be interested in as set out in section 5.3 of this policy.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>

							<ol>
								<li>We may disclose personal information outside of the jurisdiction from which it was collected. In the conduct of our business, we transfer to, hold or access personal information from various countries including Australia and the United States of America. The privacy laws of those countries may not provide the same level of protection as the privacy laws of the country from which the personal information was collected. However, this does not change our commitments to safeguard your privacy and we will comply with all applicable laws relating to the cross-border data disclosure.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Direct marketing
							<ol>
								<li>We may use personal information you have provided to us to send you information about content available on the Akela website(s) or App(s), new or updated content, special offers, promotions or competitions or other items or material that you may be interested in.</li>

Customers with an account cannot opt-out of receiving these messages.</li>
								<li>We may provide your personal information to third parties who offer goods or services that you may be interested in. These third parties may contact you directly in relation to those goods or services.</li>
