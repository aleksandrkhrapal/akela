						<li>Third Party Activities
							<ol>
								<li>The Akela Website or App may contain links to third party websites where content is not controlled by Akela (Linked Sites).</li>
								<li>Links to Linked Sites are provided for convenience only. The appearance of a link to a Linked Site does not imply Akela’s endorsement of that Linked Site or any content created or uploaded by a party other than Akela, including all text, graphics, icons, advertisements, photographs, databases, trademarks and other information created and/or uploaded by such a party (Third Party Content). Akela has no control over and is not responsible for any Linked Site or any Third Party Content.</li>
								<li>You access Linked Sites at your own risk and, to the full extent permitted by law, subject to clause 6.5, Akela disclaims all guarantees and warranties, express and implied, as to the accuracy, value, legality or otherwise of any materials or information contained on such Linked Sites and in Third Party Content.</li>
								<li>Your use of Third Party Content (including, without limitation, that featured on Linked Websites) may be subject to a third party's terms and conditions of use. It is your responsibility to check and comply with such terms.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Liability
							<ol>
								<li>To the full extent permitted by law and subject to clause 6.5, Akela excludes all representations, warranties, guarantees, terms and conditions, whether express or implied (and including, without limitation, those implied by statute, custom, law or otherwise), except as expressly set out in this Agreement.</li>
								<li>To the full extent permitted by law and subject to clause 6.5, the Website/App and the Akela Content is provided to you "as is" and on an "as available" basis, without any representation or endorsement made and without warranty or guarantee of any kind (whether express or implied). This means that Akela does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to the Website/App or that its servers are free of computer viruses, bugs or other harmful components or that defects will be corrected. As a result, you may at times experience disruption or other difficulties in using the Website/App. You should consider the potential for disruption or other difficulties in planning your use of the Website/App. To the extent permitted by law, Akela has no liability to you whatsoever for loss or costs of any kind you suffer as a result of or in connection with any disruption or other difficulties in using the Akela Website or App.</li>
								<li>To the full extent permitted by law, subject to clause 6.5 and except where the relevant liability arises from Akelas’ unlawful actions, neither Akela nor any party involved in creating, producing or delivering the Website/App accepts any liability for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of the information contained on the Akela Website/App or any responsibility for any errors, misstatements or omissions in the content on the Akela Website/App.</li>
								<li>To the full extent permitted by law, subject to clause 6.5 and except where the relevant liability arises from Akelas' unlawful actions, Akela excludes all liability to you for any damages or loss (including without limitation direct, incidental, indirect, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages or any loss of business, interest, goodwill, revenue, profit, or loss or corruption of data) arising out of your access to, or use of, or inability to use or access the Website/App or otherwise in connection with:
									<ol>
										<li><span>a.</span> your use of, or reliance on, the Website/App (or any of the Akela Content, Linked Site or Third Party Content) however caused (including, without limitation, damage or loss arising in contract, tort (including, without limitation, negligence), statute or otherwise));</li>
										<li><span>b.</span> the accuracy, timeliness, credibility, quality, utility or completeness of the information contained on the Akela Website/App; and/or</li>
										<li><span>c.</span> any errors, misstatements or omissions in the content on the Website/App, whether or not Akela is aware of such errors, misstatements or omissions.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>Certain legislation including the Australian Consumer Law, may imply warranties or conditions or impose obligations, remedies or guarantees which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified except to a limited extent. Such legislation may, for example, impose non-excludable guarantees that goods are of acceptable quality or that services will be rendered with due care and skill (with certain remedies available to consumers for certain breaches of such guarantees). To the extent that such legislation applies, this Agreement must be read subject to those statutory provisions. If those statutory provisions apply, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Akela is entitled to do so, Akela limits its liability pursuant to such provisions for any goods to the replacement, repair or refund of the cost of goods, or for services, to the re-supply or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.</li>
								<li>You agree to fully compensate Akela and its officers, employees and agents from and against reasonable liability, loss, damage, costs and expense (including, without limitation, reasonable legal expenses on a reasonable basis) and penalties incurred or suffered by any of them arising out of:
									<ol>
										<li><span>a.</span> your material breach of this Agreement (noting that for the purposes of this clause 6.6, a material breach will include, without limitation, a breach of a representation, obligation or warranty);</li>
										<li><span>b.</span> any misuse or use of the Akela Content in breach of this Agreement; and</li>
										<li><span>c.</span> any act of fraud or wilful misconduct by or on behalf of you.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>

						<li>General

								<li>We may provide you with notices in connection with this Agreement by posting such notices on the Akela Website/App or, where appropriate, by email or mail if you have provided contact details for that purpose.</li>
								<li>Akela may assign this Agreement provided that the relevant assignee undertakes to perform all of Akela obligations herein.</li>
								<li>The obligations to compensate for losses incurred by Akela and its officers, employees and agents in this Agreement are continuing obligations of the parties, separate and independent from their other obligations and survive termination of this Agreement and absolute and unconditional and unaffected by anything that might have the effect of prejudicing, releasing, discharging or affecting in any other way the liability of the party that is obliged to provide the compensation.</li>
								<li>This Agreement is governed by the laws of Western Australia, Australia, and the parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Western Australia and waive, without limitation, any claim or objection based on absence of jurisdiction or inconvenient forum.</li>
